METADATA

Olivier et al. 2019. Ecography

The dataset includes three tables (see Supplementary Dataset S1 available on Dryad Digital Repository at XXXX):
(A) Species list: taxonomic information on the taxa included in our analysis.

(B) Pairwise list: a pairwise list that reports all possible interactions between taxa included in our metaweb.

(C) Reference list: a table containing the references for trophic interactions (i.e. same as the pairwise list but with duplicated trophic interactions).

A - Species list
Each taxa was determined to the species level when possible. The taxonomic information was extracted from the World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS at http://www.marinespecies.org/). The species list contains 9 columns: the taxon level included in the metaweb, the AphiaID, information for six taxonomic ranks (i.e. phylum, class, order, family, genus, species), and abbreviations for each taxa. The few subspecies were merged at species level.


B - Pairwise list
The pairwise list includes any possible trophic interaction. We reported all trophic interactions observed or inferred and the best quality reference associated to each of them. Links are reported as they were in the literature, but species names were updated to their accepted names. The links are ordered alphabetically according to the species list. The reference list corresponds to an extended pairwise list where we list each reference we found that reported observations of trophic interactions in the metaweb.

In total, the pairwise list and reference list contain 10 to 11 columns: 
(1)	"PREDATOR" = name of the predators.

(2)	"PREY" = name of the prey.

(3)	"source" = information on the source (i.e. 'Diet' for stomach content or gut content, 'Lab' for lab experiments, 'Bait' for in-situ cages experiments, 'Biomarkers' for any information derived from, for instance fatty acids or stable isotopes, 'Globi' or other database names for a database).

(4)	"pred_lifestage" = any information on the lifestage of a predator (includes 'adults', 'juveniles', or 'NA', if not available).

(5)	"prey_lifestage" = any information on the life stage of a prey (includes 'adults', 'juveniles', 'NA'). Trophic interactions involving feeding on eggs and larvae were excluded from the food web.

(6)	"area" = geographical information on where the trophic link was collected. Links were collected from literature on the North Sea; and other basins more or less connected to the North Sea (i.e. North Atlantic, Norwegian Sea, Baltic Sea, English Channel, Celtic Sea, Irish Sea, Wadden Sea). Smaller ICES divisions were grouped together with larger divisions to keep a general idea of where the data have been collected (e.g. "Faroes" was grouped under "Iceland Sea", "Tyrrhenian Sea" was grouped under "Mediterranean Sea"). We extended the search to any part of the world if necessary (e.g. "Southern Ocean") and considered the location in the final quality assessment of the data.

(7)	"ref" = references that report observations of a trophic interaction. The list includes peer-reviewed literature, grey literature and databases. All inferred links were backed up by a reference.

(8)	"notes" = information on why a link was inferred or information was lacking. We attempted to make the notes as homogeneous as possible and reported for instance "Feeds on several species belonging to this genus".

(9)	"quality" = information on the quality of the information. The quality ranges from 1 to 4, one being the highest and four being the lowest.

(10)	"yref" = the year of publication.

(11)	"nref" = the number of references reporting observation of a specific trophic interaction
